# Movies-Change-Data-Capture-CDC-Dynamic-Tables-Project
## Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive **Change Data Capture (CDC)** solution using Snowflake's advanced features including **Streams**, **Tasks**, and **Dynamic Tables**. The system provides real-time movie booking analytics with enhanced derived fields, automated data processing, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Source Table**: `raw_movie_bookings` - Stores raw booking transactions with timestamps
2. **Stream**: `movie_bookings_stream` - Captures all changes to source table
3. **CDC Events Table**: `movie_booking_cdc_events` - Stores raw stream data with metadata
4. **Dynamic Tables**: 
   - `movie_bookings_filtered` - Enhanced view with derived fields and business logic
   - `movie_booking_insights` - Comprehensive analytics with business categorizations
5. **Tasks**: Automated processing of CDC events (every 1 minute)
6. **Streamlit Dashboard**: Clean, beginner-friendly analytics interface

- **Timestamp Tracking**: Automatic created_at and updated_at management

### Enhanced Analytics with Derived Fields
- **Business Categorizations**: 
  - Status Categories: ACTIVE (BOOKED) vs INACTIVE (CANCELLED)
  - Size Categories: SINGLE, GROUP, LARGE_GROUP based on ticket count
  - Price Categories: BUDGET, STANDARD, PREMIUM based on ticket price
- **Revenue Analysis**: Active revenue vs lost revenue tracking
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Built-in validation and quality scoring
- **Time-based Analysis**: Booking hour, day of week patterns

### Simplified Dashboard
- **Essential Filters**: Date range, booking status, movie selection
- **Key Metrics**: Total bookings, revenue, active/lost revenue
- **Core Visualizations**: Revenue by status, booking distribution, movie performance
- **Clean Interface**: Beginner-friendly design with focused functionality
- **Export Capabilities**: Download filtered data as CSV

### Sample Data

The project includes realistic sample data with:
- **5 initial bookings** across 5 different movies (September 2025)
- **Booking statuses**: BOOKED and CANCELLED (simplified for clarity)
- **Various ticket prices** ($10-$25) and quantities (1-4 tickets)
- **Time-stamped transactions** with automatic created_at/updated_at tracking
- **Realistic movie data**: Popular movies with different price points

## ðŸ”„ CDC Processing Logic

### Stream Processing
- **Automatic Capture**: Streams automatically detect all changes to source table
- **Metadata Addition**: Adds `METADATA$ACTION` and `METADATA$ISUPDATE` columns
- **Raw Data Storage**: Complete change history preserved in CDC events table

### Task Automation (`consume_stream_task`)
- **Scheduled Execution**: Runs every minute to process new changes
- **Raw Stream Consumption**: Populates CDC events table with complete stream data
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains all original fields plus change metadata
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry and error logging capabilities

### Dynamic Table Processing
- **Enhanced Filtered Table**: 2-minute refresh lag, consumes from CDC events
- **Derived Field Calculation**: Business logic applied during refresh
- **Data Quality Filtering**: Invalid records filtered out automatically
- **Analytics Table**: Downstream refresh, aggregates from filtered table

## ðŸ“ˆ Analytics Capabilities

### Enhanced Key Performance Indicators
- **Total Bookings**: Count of all valid booking transactions
- **Active Revenue**: Revenue from BOOKED status bookings
- **Lost Revenue**: Revenue from CANCELLED status bookings
- **Data Quality Score**: Percentage of valid bookings
- **Cancellation Rate**: Percentage of cancelled bookings

### Business Categorization Analytics
- **Status Categories**: ACTIVE vs INACTIVE booking analysis
- **Size Categories**: SINGLE, GROUP, LARGE_GROUP booking patterns
- **Price Categories**: BUDGET, STANDARD, PREMIUM revenue analysis
- **Change Tracking**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operation metrics

### Movie Performance Metrics
- **Revenue Analysis**: Active revenue vs lost revenue by movie
- **Booking Volume**: Total bookings with validity checks
